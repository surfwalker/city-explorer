# Project Name

**Authors**: Lillian Gales, Alex Reid
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
The City Explorer app serves the user information about the city the user requests information for.

## Getting Started
The user must use "npm start" to run server.js as also run "live-server". Once live-server opens index.html the user must enter a url e.g. http://localhost:3000 and then may be asked for an API key. After these steps the user will enter a city.
